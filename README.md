1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/cryptoquest.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cryptoquest`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm start`

## Creating a Front-end DApp

Creating a front-end DApp using React to interact with all 21 smart contracts in this project. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set up your DApp using React:

### 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

First, you’ll need to set up your development environment. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, create a new React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app cryptoquest-dapp
cd cryptoquest-dapp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You’ll need several packages to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and manage the smart contract interactions. Install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install ethers web3modal @web3-react/core @web3-react/injected-connector
```

### 3. Create a Config File for Your Contracts

Create a `contracts` folder in the `src` directory and add your contract ABIs and addresses. Here’s an example of how to structure this:

```bash
mkdir src/contracts
touch src/contracts/index.js
```

In `src/contracts/index.js`, you can export the ABIs and addresses:

```javascript
import CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG from './CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG.json';
import CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken from './CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken.json';
import CryptoQuestSwap from './CryptoQuestSwap.json';
// Import other ABIs similarly

export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ABI = CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG.abi;
export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ABI = CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken.abi;
export const CryptoQuestSwap_ABI = CryptoQuestSwap.abi;
// Export other ABIs similarly

export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ADDRESS =

 "your_contract_address_here";
export const CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ADDRESS = "your_contract_address_here";
export const CryptoQuestSwap_ADDRESS = "your_contract_address_here";
// Export other contract addresses similarly
```

### 4. Set Up Web3Modal for Wallet Connection

Web3Modal helps with wallet connections like MetaMask. Create a new file `src/utils/web3Modal.js`:

```javascript
import Web3Modal from "web3modal";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { InjectedConnector } from "@web3-react/injected-connector";
import { Web3Provider } from "@ethersproject/providers";

export const injected = new InjectedConnector({
    supportedChainIds: [1, 3, 4, 5, 42] // Adjust based on your needs
});

export const web3Modal = new Web3Modal({
    cacheProvider: true, // optional
    providerOptions: {} // required
});

export const getLibrary = (provider) => {
    const library = new Web3Provider(provider);
    library.pollingInterval = 12000;
    return library;
};
```

### 5. Create Context for Web3

Create a `Web3Context` to manage and provide web3 state across your app:

```bash
mkdir src/context
touch src/context/Web3Context.js
```

In `src/context/Web3Context.js`:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import { web3Modal, getLibrary } from '../utils/web3Modal';

export const Web3Context = createContext();

export const Web3Provider = ({ children }) => {
    const [provider, setProvider] = useState(null);
    const [library, setLibrary] = useState(null);
    const [account, setAccount] = useState(null);
    const [chainId, setChainId] = useState(null);

    const connect = async () => {
        const instance = await web3Modal.connect();
        const library = getLibrary(instance);
        const accounts = await library.listAccounts();
        const network = await library.getNetwork();

        setProvider(instance);
        setLibrary(library);
        if (accounts) setAccount(accounts[0]);
        setChainId(network.chainId);
    };

    const disconnect = async () => {
        web3Modal.clearCachedProvider();
        setProvider(null);
        setLibrary(null);
        setAccount(null);
        setChainId(null);
    };

    useEffect(() => {
        if (web3Modal.cachedProvider) {
            connect();
        }
    }, []);

    return (
        <Web3Context.Provider value={{ connect, disconnect, provider, library, account, chainId }}>
            {children}
        </Web3Context.Provider>
    );
};
```

### 6. Interacting with Smart Contracts

Create a file `src/utils/contracts.js` to set up the contracts:

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import {
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ABI,
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ABI,
    CryptoQuestSwap_ABI,
    // Import other ABIs
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ADDRESS,
    CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ADDRESS,
    CryptoQuestSwap_ADDRESS,
    // Import other addresses
} from '../contracts';

export const getContract = (abi, address, library) => {
    const signer = library.getSigner();
    return new ethers.Contract(address, abi, signer);
};

export const getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPGContract = (library) => {
    return getContract(CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ABI, CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPG_ADDRESS, library);
};

export const getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisTokenContract = (library) => {
    return getContract(CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ABI, CryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisToken_ADDRESS, library);
};

export const getCryptoQuestSwapContract = (library) => {
    return getContract(CryptoQuestSwap_ABI, CryptoQuestSwap_ADDRESS, library);
};

// Create similar functions for other contracts
```

### 7. Create UI Components

Create React components to interact with the contracts. For example, to create a component for the main game contract:

```bash
mkdir src/components
touch src/components/Game.js
```

In `src/components/Game.js`:

```javascript
import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';
import { Web3Context } from '../context/Web3Context';
import { getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPGContract } from '../utils/contracts';

const Game = () => {
    const { library, account } = useContext(Web3Context);
    const [player, setPlayer] = useState(null);

    const createPlayer = async () => {
        const contract = getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPGContract(library);
        const tx = await contract.createPlayer();
        await tx.wait();
    };

    const fetchPlayer = async () => {
        const contract = getCryptoQuestTheShardsOfGenesisMMPORPGContract(library);
        const player = await contract.players(account);
        setPlayer(player);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={createPlayer}>Create Player</button>
            <button onClick={fetchPlayer}>Fetch Player</button>
            {player && (
                <div>
                    <p>Level: {player.level}</p>
                    <p>Experience: {player.experience}</p>
                    {/* Display other player details */}
                </div>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export default Game;
```

### 8. Integrate Components into the App

Use the `Web3Provider` and add your components to `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Web3Provider } from './context/Web3Context';
import Game from './components/Game';

function App() {
    return (
        <Web3Provider>
            <div className="App">
                <h1>CryptoQuest: The Shards of Genesis</h1>
                <Game />
                {/* Add other components */}
            </div>
        </Web3Provider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### 9. Run Your DApp

Start your React app:

```bash
npm start
```

This setup gives you a React front-end that can interact with your smart contracts using Ethers.js. You can expand the `Game` component and create additional components to cover all functionalities of your contracts, such as token staking, marketplace interactions, governance, and more.
